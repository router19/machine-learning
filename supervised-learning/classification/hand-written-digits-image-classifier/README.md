# hand-written-digits-image-classifier

This directory: A simple hand-written-digits-image-classifier project, based on a single pom.xml file.

This can be used as a minimal starting point for your own projects.

This project uses STOCASTIC algorithm to create layers and then classify the handwritten images from 0 to 9. The accuracy level has currently reached 90% which can be improved further with more optimisation and creation of internal layers.

This project downloads the MNIST image data
